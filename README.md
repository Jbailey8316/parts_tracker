# parts_tracker

## Purpose
This project was developed around the need to streamline production schedule creation and parts tracking across multiple departments.  Microsoft Excel and VBA was chosen as the prefered platform to maintain a user friendly format that could be adopted quickly within the business.  This made for a simple method of communication of what parts were completed, in-process, or scrapped (MDR) due to quality concerns.  It was initially designed for small scale use (1 value stream/1 production line) with the intent of expanding across multiple value streams/production lines and departments later on. It's main focus was to track all in house production parts and to generate station breakdowns.  The tracking allowed high schedule visibility across all departments for management and the break downs were printed and handed out to employees for daily tasks. All departments had access to the workbook via the company network and could update the parts based on their department's needs.  

## Results
VBA was utilized to automate tasks and to pre-generate schedules.

## Summary
This project successfully created a tracking program that was easy to roll out and adopt. It also helped automate repetitive tasks within excel for production scheduling along with creating visibility of all parts moving within the facility.
